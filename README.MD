# Lionel Messi (GOAT)

*Lionel Messi is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. He is widely regarded as the greatest football player of all time. Here, I have tried analysing his career goals and some other performance metrices. The data was collected/scraped from multiple souces like Kaggle, Fbref, Understat, and Transfermarkt.*


## 1. Goals by Competition, Venue, Type and Playing Position
![one](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/1.png)

*- Messi has scored 474 in LaLiga and 129 goals in CL. His 40% goals have come in away format(really impressive). He mostly plays ar Right Winger and has scored most goals from that position. However, he has been really good playing as a Center Forward as well. Also, Messi is a left footed player hence 64% of goals he's scored using his magical left foot. What's impressive however is that his 7.6% goals are from Freekick.*

## 2. Favourite Opponents (Club)

*- Some of the biggest clubs are in the list. Could definetely be surprising to those who think Messi isn't clutch. Also he's scored a lot of goals against the PL big top 6 teams. So, ig he can asctually do on a cold rainy night in Stoke.* :smile:

## 3. Goals Minutes Analysis
![three](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/3.png)

*- Messi has scored most number of goals in 55th, 78th and 87th minute (13 goals).*

## 4. Most Assists to Messi
![four](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/4.png)

*- Luis Suarez has provided the most assists to Messi (48) followed by Dani Alves (42).* 

## 5. Messi's All League Goals and Assists
![six](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/6.png)

*- That 50 Goals and 16 Assists in the league alone in 2011-12. Peak Pep Ball. Peak Messi. The best.*

## 6. Some More League Stats
![five](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/5.png)

*- The first plot shows that whenever there have been spikes in shots, there have been spikes in goals. Simply, more shots=more goals. The second plot shows his goals/90 and assists/90. Putting his creative side aside, Messi is a gargantuan goalscorer.*

## 7. International Stats
![seven](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/7.png)

*- Messi's favourite opponent has been Bolivia. Some big South American countries like Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are there too. Similarly Messi has scored 13 total goals in Copa America and only 6 in different World Cups he's played.*

## 8. Goals vs xG, Assists vs xA (League Only)
![eight](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/8.png)

*- Messi has overperformed his xG in most of the league seasons. Shows how great finisher he is.*

## 9. Leo Messi vs Others ( League Only)
![nine](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/9.png)

*- In the first plot I have compared Messi's xGs with of Ronaldo's and Lewandowski's, after the 2017-18 season, Lewandowski has been above the other 2 in the xG chart. In 2017-18 they all has almost same xG. Also, I was surprised to see in the second chart that both Ronaldo and Messi used to have more shots/90 than Lewandowski ( who is a striker ) before the 2021-22 season. Similarly, in the third chart I tried comparing Messi's key passes/90 stat with Kevin de Bruyne (probably best in the business) to show the creative side of Messi.*

## 10. Messi's Finishing vs Other Forwards
![ten](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Messi-Analysis/blob/main/output/10.png)

*- This dashboard shows Messi's finishing after he left Barcelona and started playing for PSG. He underperformed in his first season ( could be seen in the 2021-22 shots plot ) but is slowly picking his form this season ( he has already equalled his previous season goal tally in only 11 matches this season ). Also in the Goals/90 vs xG/90 scatter plot, Messi is seen at quite high position, however, he used to be an outlier in such plots and we all know Messi will climb up his way to the top again.*

*This last dashboard was made after reading [this](https://medium.com/geekculturean-introduction-to-football-player-dashboards-using-python-and-matplotlib-eb5328dfe85f) blog on Medium.*


Thank You. Have a great day. :blush: :heart: :)
